# /docsync:pr-review - PR Documentation Validator

This command validates that all git changes comply with project documentation and posts a GitHub PR review with inline comments and change requests for violations.

## Arguments

- `$1` (optional): Custom docs directory path (default: `docs/`)

## Usage

```bash
/docsync:pr-review
/docsync:pr-review documentation/
/docsync:pr-review docs/api/
```

## Instructions

You are the /docsync:pr-review command. Your job is to validate that git changes comply with project documentation and post a GitHub PR review.

### Prerequisites

This command requires GitHub CLI (`gh`) to be installed and authenticated. When running in GitHub Actions, authentication is automatically provided via `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

**Important**: This command only works in a GitHub Actions pull_request context. For local development, use `/docsync` instead.

### Step 1: Determine the docs directory

Set `DOCS_DIR` to:
- `$1` if provided (first argument)
- `docs/` if no argument provided

### Step 2: Get PR information

Use `gh pr view` to get PR information:

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,baseRefName,headRefName
```

Store these values for later use.

### Step 3: Find all documentation files

Use the Glob tool to find documentation files:
- Pattern: `$DOCS_DIR/**/*.md`
- Pattern: `$DOCS_DIR/**/*.txt`
- Pattern: `$DOCS_DIR/**/*.rst`
- Pattern: `$DOCS_DIR/**/*.adoc`

Store the list of files. If no documentation files found, display:
```
No documentation files found in: $DOCS_DIR
Supported formats: .md, .txt, .rst, .adoc
```

### Step 4: Get git changes

Use `gh pr diff --name-only` to get changed files:

```bash
gh pr diff --name-only
```

Parse the output to get the list of changed files.

If no changes found, display:
```
No git changes detected to validate.
Both working directory and staging area are clean.
```

### Step 5: Spawn parallel subagents

For EACH documentation file, spawn a subagent using the Task tool with:

- `subagent_type`: "general-purpose"
- `prompt`: The following instructions with the doc file path and changed files substituted

```
You are a documentation validator subagent for PR review. Your job is to validate that git changes comply with a specific documentation file.

## Your Assigned Documentation File
[DOCUMENT_FILE_PATH]

## Changed Files to Analyze
[CHANGED_FILES_LIST - comma separated with status]

## Instructions

1. Read the documentation file at [DOCUMENT_FILE_PATH] using the Read tool
2. Extract all rules, conventions, guidelines, and requirements from the documentation
3. For each changed file in [CHANGED_FILES_LIST]:
   - Read the file content using the Read tool
   - Analyze if the changes comply with documentation requirements
   - Identify violations, inconsistencies, or missing implementations

## Output Format - JSON ONLY

Return a VALID JSON object (no markdown, no code blocks, just raw JSON):

{
  "document": "filename.md",
  "status": "PASS|FAIL|WARNING",
  "findings": [
    {
      "file": "path/to/file.js",
      "line": 42,
      "severity": "error|warning|info",
      "message": "Description of the issue",
      "suggestion": "Optional: suggested fix code"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of findings",
  "recommendations": ["List of recommendations"]
}

IMPORTANT:
- For inline comments, estimate the line number from the file content
- The "suggestion" field will be formatted as a GitHub suggestion if provided
- Use PASS if all changes comply
- Use WARNING for minor issues or unclear rules
- Use FAIL for clear violations
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text
```

### Step 6: Aggregate results and determine review status

After all subagents complete, parse all JSON responses and determine:

- `OVERALL_STATUS`: "APPROVE" if all PASS, "REQUEST_CHANGES" if any FAIL, "COMMENT" if any WARNING but no FAIL
- `INLINE_COMMENTS`: Array of all findings with file/line information
- `BODY_SUMMARY`: Aggregated summary of all findings

### Step 7: Build and post the PR review

Create the review body using this template:

```
## DocSync Validation Report

**Overall Status**: [OVERALL_STATUS]

- Documentation files analyzed: [N]
- Changed files analyzed: [N]
- Issues found: [N]

---

### Summary

[AGGREGATED_SUMMARY]

---

### Details by Document

[FOR EACH DOCUMENT]
**[DOCUMENT_NAME]**: [STATUS]

[Document-specific findings and recommendations]

---

### Review Policy

- **APPROVE**: All changes comply with documentation
- **REQUEST_CHANGES**: One or more violations found - please address before merging
- **COMMENT**: Minor issues or suggestions provided

_This review was generated by the DocSync plugin for Claude Code._
```

Post the review using `gh pr review`:

```bash
gh pr review --[APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES|COMMENT] --body "[REVIEW_BODY_CONTENT]"
```

### Step 8: Display confirmation

After posting the review, display:

```
# PR Review Posted

Status: [OVERALL_STATUS]
PR: #[PR_NUMBER] - [PR_TITLE]

Inline comments posted: [N]
Body summary: [TRUNCATED_PREVIEW]
```

## GitHub Suggestion Format

For inline code suggestions, use GitHub's supported format:

```
This code violates the documented convention.

```suggestion
def correct_function():
    """Correct implementation following docs."""
    return documented_pattern
```
```

GitHub will render this as an applyable suggestion in the PR UI.

## Notes

- All subagents run in parallel for efficiency
- Each subagent works independently on one documentation file
- Reviews use `gh` CLI which must be installed and authenticated
- In GitHub Actions, `GITHUB_TOKEN` provides authentication automatically
- REQUEST_CHANGES status can block PR merge if branch protection is configured
- Inline comments with line numbers can be posted using `gh pr comment` for file-wide feedback
